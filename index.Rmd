The materials, practicals and examples for this course were originally developed for the short course "Mathematical Models for Infectious Disease Dynamics" organised and run by the Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses Program between 2010-2020. A number of instructors, in addition to those involved in the current iteration, have contributed and adapted these materials over the years as the course has evolved. We would like to thank and acknowledge the contribution of all of these course alumni:
